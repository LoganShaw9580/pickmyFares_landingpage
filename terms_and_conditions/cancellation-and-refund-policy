                <h3 class="title-style-2">All airlines refunds/ future credits are subject to each airline fare rules, procedures and policies.</h3>
                <p>
                    All the services freights after making a reservation are on-refundable and are subject to change without any previous notice. Government- assessed levies and freights are subject to change and you'll only be charged the final total quantum as shown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the maximum number of airline tickets is non-refundable. As if the supplier of your ticket rules allows cancellation and refunds and we accepted your request for a refund, you aren't a “no show” (most “no show” bookings aren't eligible for any kind of disclaimer from the supplier for refund processing), and if we're suitable to secure quitclaims from suppliers to reuse this requested cancellation and refund.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Utmost of the airline tickets and service freights are on-refundable after 24 hrs. of booking. Cancellation must do over the phone or dispatch only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's no specific time period for how long may the requested refund to be reused. Once you handed our client service agent with your cancellation request also the dispatch transferred by the service agent is the announcement for you that your cancellation request has been entered. This refund/ cancellation don’t automatically qualify you for a refund. This dispatch only provides an acknowledgment of your request.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On your refund request, we will work with the airline to induce a disclaimer grounded on the airline and notify you of the airline's decision. Our services are on-refundable. We completely depend on the airline for the receiving of requested refunds. Once the refund is reused and approved by the airline it may take time to reflect on your bank statement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The entire procedure of refund may take the time of 30-60 days from the day of entering the refund request. The airline will charge a penalty for the refund. All the freights of refund are charged per passenger, per ticket base. These freights will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the airline or a disclaimer has been entered and when the airline rules permit similar refunds.
                </p>



                <h3 class="title-style-2">Price</h3>
                <p>
                    All prices displayed on our website are subject to change at any time without previous notice. Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and other trip suppliers may change their prices without notice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Still, we will notify you of the price increase before taking any farther way, if a price increase occurs after you have made a reservation that affects your trip package. Still, no price increases will affect your trip package once your reservation has been perfected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All reservations are on-refundable unless else stated. However, please communicate us, if you find that you must cancel a reservation for any reason. We'll do all we can to help you in this process. Still, please be apprehensive that indeed if your cancellation is allowed and your reservation is therefore refundable, it may be subject to an executive cancellation figure of $ 200.00 per passenger for transnational breakouts, $ 300.00 for trans- border breakouts between the USA and Canada, and CAD150.00 for domestic breakouts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title-style-2">FOR US BOOKINGS, Indeed IF YOU’RE TICKET IS NONREFUNDABLE</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Within the same day at night you may cancel your booking, “subject to our cancellation freights”.</li>
                    <li>All Airline Basic Economy tickets and Promotion tickets cancellation aren't permitted on-refundable tickets. </li>
                    <li>All reservations are also on-changeable and on-transferable unless else stated. However, please be apprehensive that similar change is subject to a figure of$ 150, If you need to make a change to your reservation and that change is allowed.00 per passenger for domestic breakouts,$ 200.00 for trans- border breakouts, and $ 300.00 for all other breakouts. There may also be freights or differences in the price charged by any third- party suppliers (e.g., airlines, hospices, voyage lines, etc.) included in your reservation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please be apprehensive that formerly you have made a reservation, name changes aren’t allowed. However, you'll have to cancel your original reservation — if allowed — and also make a new reservation with a new flight at the also-current rate using the correct spelling of the name, If you find you need to change or correct the spelling of a name after you ’ve made a reservation. This will probably dodge freights and penalties. Thus, it's imperative — and your responsibility — to corroborate the spelling of the names of all passengers before making your reservation.</p>
                <p>
                    The rate applied on the date of allocation of the ticket is only valid for a ticket completely employed and in the successional order of flight parts on the dates indicated. Indecorous use may void the ticket and affect in the cancellation of the entire trip. Pricing is displayed in CA currency.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title-style-2">PAYMENT AND FLIGHT INFORMATION AND Evidence</h3>

                <p>Some banks and credit card companies charge a figure for transnational deals. They will appear on your credit or bank card statement as a foreign or transnational sale figure. For illustration, if you make a trip reservation through our website from outside the United States using a U.S. credit card, your bank may convert the payment quantum to your original currency and may charge you a figure for the conversion. The quantum of the charge appearing on your credit or bank card statement may be in your original currency and different than the purchase quantum shown on the billing summary runner for the reservation.</p>

                <p>
                    In addition, a foreign sale figure may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside the United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reserving transnational trip through our website may be considered a transnational sale by the bank or credit card company sincevflyus.com may pass your payment on to a transnational trip supplier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your bank or credit card company determines the currency exchange rate and the quantum of the foreign sale figure on the day it processes the sale. Please communicate your bank or credit card company should you have any questions about these freights or the exchange rate applied to your sale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reserving announcement once your purchase is complete, you should admit a dispatch named “Reserving Announcement.” Your booking may give you with an evidence number before a ticket has been issued. However, the booking process isn't complete and the chow is subject to change until a ticket is issued, If this is the case.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your ticket has been issued, you should admit your electronic ticket.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We explosively recommend that your-confirm your flight reservation with the airline 24 hours prior to departure for domestic breakouts, and 72 hours prior to departure for transnational breakouts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title-style-2">BOOKING Emendations AND CHARGES </h3>
                <p>Booking made onvflyus.com may have some charges that are being charged as per the directive of the airline. The charges may vary by flight and booking class. The correction figure may also vary by airline to airline, flight, and reserving class. All changes must be made at least 72 hours prior to the departure date. Time duration can be different from airline to airline, thus it's advised to cross-check it with client support for accurate information. </p>


                <h3 class="title-style-2">CANCEL & EXCHANGE </h3>
                <p>All most of the aircraft tickets are on-refundable. In some situations where the carrier allows cancellation, also a credit might be considered against unborn tickets by the same rubberneck on the same airline. The airlines have their own policy of credit termination date, which can’t be employed after its expiry. So, in case of cancellation, we request guests to examine the limitations with a client service specialist. Cancellation of tickets must be done before the flight takes off differently, we don’t assure or promise any cancellation. However, also you'll be needed to bear the difference in the chow if applicable, if you're formerly prepared to make a new reservation and want to use the airline credit. Similar kinds of strategies and programs are made by the operation of carriers, which aren't in our control. </p>
                <p>We can accept refund requests only if the ensuing conditions have been met:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have applied for a cancellation and refund with us and if the chow rules give for cancellation and refunds; </li>
                    <li> You aren't a “no show" (most “no show” bookings are in-eligible for any disclaimer from suppliers for refund processing); and we’re suitable to secure quitclaims from suppliers to reuse this requested cancellation and refund. </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>We're unfit to give a specific timeline for how long it may take for this requested refund to be reused. All refund requests are reused in a successional format. Once you have handed our client service agent with your cancellation request, we will also shoot you a dispatch announcement that your request has been entered. This announcement doesn't automatically qualify you for a refund. This only provides you with an acknowledgment of your request and provides you with a shadowing number. Upon damage of your request, we will work with the suppliers similar as airlines, hospices, auto- reimbursement companies to induce a disclaimer grounded on airline and other supplier rules and notify you of the supplier decision. Our services freights associated with the original trip reservation or booking aren't refundable. Please note that we're dependent on the suppliers for entering the requested refunds. Once the refund has been approved by the supplier it may take fresh time for this to appear on your credit card statement. Generally, all suppliers will charge a penalty for a refund. This entire process may take 60-90 days from damage of your request to entering credit on your statement. Piecemeal from the airlines and other suppliers refund penalties, vflyus.com will charge a post-ticketing services figure, as applicable. All refund freights are charged on a per-passenger, per- ticket base. These freights will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a disclaimer has been entered and when the airline/ supplier rules permit similar refunds. However, we will reimburse you our post-ticketing service freights applicable to your agent supported refund request, but not our booking freights for the original trip reservation or booking, If such a refund isn't reused by the supplier.</p>
